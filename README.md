# Movie-Night

Please return a git repository (either by compressed archive attached to an email, or publicly accessible link - for example, on GitHub) before Friday 2nd September - this code submission will form the basis for the technical discussion during an interview.

 

Should you have any questions about the following task, the recruiting manager won’t be available to assist until 30th August 2022 as he’s on annual leave.

 

The software we require for this test is a basic CRUD API, the high level requirements being:

 

Create a program that maintains a Movie catalog allowing creation/update/deletion of:

    • Movies

    • Movie Directors

    • Movie Ratings

 

All communication with the program must be via REST, and the program must allow searching on the following criteria:

    • Search movies by Director

    • Search movies where the rating is above a provided rating.

 

The key technical requirements are as follows:

 

    - [x] Must use Spring Framework to create a wholly self-contained artifact, built by Maven. 

    - [x] Must compile in Java 8. A later runtime is perfectly acceptable, but compilation must be in Java 8.

    - [x] Must be within a git repository (remote not necessary, use own judgement on commit strategy).

    - [ ] Must persist data across application restarts (may persist outside the runnable artifact) using an RDBMS with appropriate model relationships. 

    - [ ] Must allow data manipulation via REST.

    - [ ] Must contain an appropriate level of Unit Test coverage (use own judgment in defining "appropriate"). 

    - [ ] Must provide documentation to describe application functionality (JavaDoc, UML diagrams and/or text based documentation is acceptable, again, use own judgement).
